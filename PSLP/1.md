# Probability

### Conditional Probability
Likelihood of an event A occurring given that another event B has already occurred.
$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $$

### Total Probability
$$ P(A) = \sum_{i} P(A | B_i) \cdot P(B_i) $$

### Bayes Theorem
$$ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) \cdot P(B)}{P(A)} $$
